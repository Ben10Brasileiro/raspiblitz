Onion services offer various privacy and security benefits to their users.

* Location hiding
An onion service's IP address is protected. Onion services are an overlay network on top of TCP/IP.

* End-to-end authentication
When a user visits a particular onion, the content they are seeing can only come from that particular onion. No impersonation is possible.

* End-to-end encryption
Onion service traffic is encrypted from the client to the onion host. This is like getting strong SSL/HTTPS for free.

* NAT punching
Onion services don't need open ports because they punch through NAT. They only establish outgoing connections.
