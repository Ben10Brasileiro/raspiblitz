MEEK-AZURE circumvents sophisticated censorship. In contrast to the OBFS4 bridges (see menu entries above), MEEK-AZURE is based on another technique, which should also work for users in China.

You should only activate MEEK-AZURE, if necessary and if OBFS4 bridges don't work. MEEK-AZURE could lead to a less stable and slower data transfer speed. SNOWFLAKE seems to be more performant than MEEK-AZURE, but it is currently in an experimental status. By default, MEEK-AZURE is deactivated.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates MEEK-AZURE to bypass Tor blocking in a
  country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however, it doesn't help if
  a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- Ignore all the error messages. In the end, you should see
  "Bootstrapped 100%: Done".
- Tor Statistics (and probably some other tools) will not work under
  MEEK-AZURE.
