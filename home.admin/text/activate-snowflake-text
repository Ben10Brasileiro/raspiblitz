SNOWFLAKE circumvents sophisticated censorship. In contrast to the OBFS4 bridges (see menu entries above), SNOWFLAKE is based on another technique, which should also work for users in China.

You should only activate SNOWFLAKE, if necessary and if OBFS4 bridges don't work. SNOWFLAKE could lead to a slower data transfer speed. However, SNOWFLAKE seems to be more performant than MEEK-AZURE, but it is currently in an experimental status. By default, SNOWFLAKE is deactivated.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates SNOWFLAKE to bypass Tor blocking in a
  country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however, it doesn't help if
  a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- Ignore all the error messages. In the end, you should see
  "Bootstrapped 100%: Done".
- Tor Statistics (and probably some other tools) will not work under
  SNOWFLAKE.
