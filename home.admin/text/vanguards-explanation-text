Even after deployment of the new v3 onion service protocol, the attacks facing onion services are wide-ranging, and still require more extensive modifications to fix in Tor-core itself.

Because of this, Tor Project have decided to rapid-prototype these defenses in a controller addon in order to make them available ahead of their official Tor-core release, for onion services that require high security as soon as possible.

For details about the defenses themselves, please see README_TECHNICAL.md.
For additional security information, please see README_SECURITY.md.
