Raspiblitz project comment:

Here we thank TorBox project.
Great part of the Tor menu (countermeasure options such as bridges, bypass idle, over vpn) scripts was sourced from TorBox.
Tor relay scripts were removed from Raspiblitz in order to have device isolation of bitcoin services and onion traffic and to free up resources.
