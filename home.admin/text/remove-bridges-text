This menu entry REMOVES all or specific OBFS4 bridges. However, OBFS4 bridges are necessary to bypass Tor blocking in a country. To use this feature, you need to have at least one OBFS4 bridge configured.

IMPORTANT
If you remove ALL OBFS4 bridges, you will be directly connected to the Tor network, which is the default.
However, instead of removing OBFS4 bridges, we recommend simply to deactivate them.
