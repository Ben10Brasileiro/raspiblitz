You choose to update to the newest stable version of Tor. This menu entry
is a fall-back option if something goes wrong, and menu entry 1 didn't

and compiles it on the Raspberry Pi. Usually, you should update the entire
base system (menu entry 1).

IMPORTANT
- Don't remove power from your Tor during the update.
