The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the internet. The Tor Project is primarily responsible for maintaining software for the Tor network. How can you support the Tor Project and the Tor network?

There are a few things you can do:
- Spread the word! Tell others about Tor.
- Run a relay to help the Tor network grow.
- Help translate the documentation into other languages.
- Help reporting and solving issues (https://gitlab.torproject.org/groups/tpo/web/-/issues)
- Donate (https://donate.torproject.org).
- Tell your story: How has Tor helped you?

- ...and more -> https://2019.www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer

Keep in mind: Each time Tor gains a new user, the anonymity and privacy of all Tor users gain.
