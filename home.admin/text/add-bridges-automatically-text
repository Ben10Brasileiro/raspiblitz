With this menu entry, you can ADD BRIDGES AUTOMATICALLY. Bridges are necessary for Tor to bypass Tor blocking in a country.

IMPORTANT
- Tor is not always able to catch a bridge. If it stuck for several
  minutes, press CTR-C and add the bridges manually.
- For security reasons, only one bridge is acquired about every 24 hours.
